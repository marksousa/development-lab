- Import a logo game from art.py
- Sort two different dictionary elements from list data in game_data.py
- Create a Function that promoves the followers number's comparison of these two dictionaries in previous task

  - `Compare A: Shakira, a Musician, from Colombia.`

    VS

  - `Against B: Demi Lovato, a Musician and actress, from United States.`

- Create a Function that inputs the guess's player:

  - `Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B': `

- Create a function that calculates the result comparison
  - It's Correct?!
    - **add a point on game score**
    - **continue the game**
